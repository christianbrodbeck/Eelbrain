"""Derivative-oriented cache primitives for :mod:`eelbrain._experiment`.

The goal of this module is providing a general interface for building
branching data analysis pipelines that allow caching intermediate results at
each processing step.

The cache is organized around a graph of registered dependency nodes.

- :class:`Input` declares one source node in the dependency graph.
- :class:`Derivative` declares one computed node in the dependency graph.
- :class:`Request` binds one node to specific analysis parameters given in a
  global pipeline state and local options.
- :class:`DerivativeRegistry` resolves dependencies and validates cached
  artifacts via sidecar manifests.

Within that framework:

- A derivative is *keyed* by the subset of pipeline state that selects which
  artifact it represents (such as subject, preprocessing applied, ...) and
  relevant analysis options that affect building of the artifact.
- A derivative is *built* by computing that artifact from the current pipeline
  state and options.
- A derivative is *serialized* by saving the in-memory result to disk and
  loading it back later.
- A derivative is *fingerprinted* by recording the normalized settings and
  inputs that determine whether a cached artifact is still valid.

Manifests store the derivative fingerprint plus dependency fingerprints, so a
cache hit is valid when the artifact, its normalized key, and its dependency
graph still match the current pipeline configuration.

Dependency edges are validated for key-field coverage (see
:meth:`DerivativeRegistry._check_edge_key_coverage`): when a dependency's output
is sensitive to a state field, the depending node must either key on that field
too, or pin it on the edge (the way aggregation over a field is expressed).
Otherwise the parent would silently share one cache slot across different values
of that field.

Artifacts inside ``cache-dir`` keep sidecar manifests and can be rebuilt
automatically when they go stale. Artifacts stored elsewhere are treated as
user-managed outputs: their manifests are mirrored under the owning
derivative's node directory in the cache (e.g. an ICA at
``derivatives/mne/sub-01/...`` → ``cache-dir/<node-name>/sub-01/...``) and they
are not overwritten without an explicit opt-in from the caller.

Garbage collection
------------------

Stale artifacts left behind by changed definitions or removed nodes are found
and removed by :mod:`.garbage_collection`; the entry points are
:meth:`DerivativeRegistry.scan_cache` and
:meth:`~eelbrain._experiment.derivative_cache.garbage_collection.GCReport.collect`.

    literal

    normalize
        Called as ``normalize(value)`` before validation; the return

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Registered node name for the dependency. This can refer to either a
        registered :class:`Derivative` or a registered :class:`Input`.
    label
        Optional manifest label for this dependency edge. In most cases this
        can be omitted, and the dependency name is used as the manifest key.
        Set ``label`` when the same dependency name can appear more than once
        in one dependency set with different state or options, so each edge
        has a stable distinct name in the dependency manifest.
    state
        Optional state updates for this dependency. The mapping is merged on
        top of the parent state before resolving the dependency. This is also
        how a dependency's key field is satisfied when the parent does not key
        on it — pinning it here (the way aggregation over a field is expressed)
        covers it for the edge-coverage check.
    options
        Optional child request options passed to the target node when the
        dependency is resolved. Keys must be declared by the target node and
        can refer to either standard options from
        ``target.key_options`` or view-only options from
        ``target.view_options``. The registry splits the mapping into
        artifact-affecting ``Request.options`` and post-load
        ``Request.view_options`` for the child request.
    view
        Optional data view to load from the dependency. When this dependency
        is requested through ``ctx.load(...)`` inside the dependent node, the
        named view is loaded instead of the dependency's normal return value.
        The view name is also forwarded to
        :meth:`DependencyNode.dependency_fingerprint` so the manifest describes
        the same data view.

    Notes

class DependencyNode(Generic[T]):
    """Base class for all registered dependency-graph nodes.

    Subclasses participate in the cache graph by providing three pieces of
    information:

    - a stable ``name`` used for registry lookup and dependency edges
    - a dependency list describing which other nodes this node needs
    - a fingerprint describing whether the current request still matches the
      artifact represented by this node

    Most users should subclass :class:`Input` or :class:`Derivative` rather
    than subclassing :class:`DependencyNode` directly.
    The following attributes are relevant for both subclasses:

    Attributes
    ----------
    name
        Stable registry name for this node. Must be unique across all
        registered nodes and must not change once artifacts have been cached
        under that name.
    key_fields
        State fields whose values determine this node's output. Reading any
        state field outside ``key_fields`` / ``fixed_state`` while determining
        or shaping the node's value raises :class:`RuntimeError` (see
        :meth:`Request._state_check_context` for the methods this covers). Use
        :meth:`override_key_fields` when a node's key depends on the state
        dynamically; a node that does need not also declare a static
        ``key_fields``. An explicit empty tuple opts out (the
        node manages its own identity via a :meth:`Derivative.key` override).
        ``key_fields`` also feeds the edge-coverage check (see
        :meth:`DerivativeRegistry._check_edge_key_coverage`): every field a
        dependency keys on must be pinned on the edge or covered by the parent's
        key fields.
    key_options
        Options that affect how this node's artifact is built, and that enter
        the cache key. Keys declare the option names; values are their
        defaults, or :class:`OptionSpec` declarations that additionally
        normalize and validate the value when a request is resolved. Options
        are node-local: they apply to this node only and do not propagate to
        dependencies unless the node explicitly forwards them via
        :meth:`Request.options_for`. Which options actually enter the key
        can be narrowed per request via :meth:`override_key_options`.
    view_options
        Options that only shape the returned value after the artifact has
        been built or loaded. They do not affect cache identity. Like
        :attr:`key_options`, values are plain defaults or :class:`OptionSpec`
        declarations.
    fixed_state
        State entries that this node always forces to specific values,
        regardless of caller-provided state. Applied by the registry on top
        of any incoming state when this node is resolved, so conflicting
        caller state is overridden. Use this when the node name encodes a
        specific state value — e.g. a raw-processing node that always
        implies ``state['raw'] == raw_name`` — so that :class:`Dependency`
        declarations targeting this node need not redundantly repeat a
        ``state`` override. The counterpart to :attr:`key_fields`: where
        ``key_fields`` declares polymorphism over state keys, ``fixed_state``
        pins them.
    cache_policy
        Whether this node has a tracked artifact and manifest. The default
        (:attr:`CachePolicy.NEVER`) means it has neither, so
        :meth:`Request.key`, :attr:`Request.artifact_path` and
        :attr:`Request.manifest_path` raise :class:`TypeError`.
        :class:`Derivative` sets :attr:`CachePolicy.REQUIRED`; an :class:`Input`
        whose artifact is user-owned but provenance-tracked sets
        :attr:`CachePolicy.EXTERNAL`.
    cache_log_level
        Log level for the standard cache hit/build messages, which are the
        pipeline's progress report for anything expensive. Set to ``None`` to
        suppress them. Only nodes with a tracked artifact emit them.

    registry
        The registry that resolved this request and that should be used for
        dependency resolution, manifest handling, and canonicalization.
    state
        Fully resolved pipeline state for this request. State defines the

        nested dependency loads unless a dependency overrides it.
    options
        Options declared by ``node`` that affect how the artifact is built.
        These options are node-local: they affect the target node, and only
        reach deeper dependencies when that node explicitly forwards them.

        the underlying artifact or input has been loaded.
    controls
        Explicit request controls that are not node options, such as

        The output is suitable for fingerprints, keys, and manifests: dicts are
        sorted by key, sets are sorted, numpy scalars are unwrapped, and
        :class:`Path` objects become strings. Unrecognized types fall back to
        ``repr()``.

        Domain-specific types handled here (:class:`~eelbrain.Var`,
        :class:`~eelbrain.NDVar`, :class:`~eelbrain.Factor`,
        :class:`~eelbrain.Interaction`, :class:`Configuration`) are an
        intentional coupling between the cache
        kernel and the Eelbrain data model; they allow fingerprints and keys to
        contain arbitrary data objects without callers having to pre-serialize
        them.

        Other rich objects can participate by defining ``_cache_form_()``,
        returning a simple (canonicalizable) representation of the object's
        identity. For objects used as key-tier option values, the owning node
        should declare the option with an :class:`OptionSpec` whose
        ``normalize`` accepts both the object and this form, so that a request
        reconstructed from a stored manifest (offline revalidation) re-parses
        the value into the rich object.
