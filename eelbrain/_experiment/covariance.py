    MNE whitens each channel-type block by scaling its eigen-directions with
    :math:`1/\\sqrt\\lambda`, so the smallest retained eigenvalue is amplified
    :math:`\\sqrt{\\lambda_{max}/\\lambda_{min}}` times more than the largest. For
    Maxwell-filtered data that ratio routinely reaches ten orders of magnitude, because
    the SSS basis is ill-conditioned; the inverse solution then treats a near-null
    direction of that basis as by far the most reliable measurement available, even
    though the noise recording says little about it.

    :func:`mne.cov.regularize` adds ``reg`` times the mean retained eigenvalue to the
    diagonal within the retained subspace of each of its blocks, leaving the null space at exactly zero so the rank is
    preserved. Solving :math:`(\\lambda_{max} + r\\bar\\lambda) / (\\lambda_{min}
    + r\\bar\\lambda) = K` for :math:`r` gives the smallest regularization that brings a
    block to the target condition number ``K``.

    Targeting a condition number rather than fixing ``reg`` makes this self-limiting: a
    block that already satisfies ``K`` yields ``r = 0`` and is returned untouched, while
    the blocks that do not all end up with the same bound on whitener amplification,

class Covariance(Configuration):
    """Base class for covariance estimation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    method
        Covariance estimation method.
    max_condition
        Limit how unevenly the covariance weights different directions in the data, by
        adding just enough regularization to keep its condition number at or below this
        value (see Notes); ``0`` to use the covariance as estimated, without
        regularization.

    Notes
    -----
    Source localization uses the noise covariance to *whiten* the data. Whitening
    decomposes sensor space into the eigen-directions of the covariance and scales each
    direction by :math:`1/\\sqrt\\lambda`, the inverse square root of its noise variance
    (its eigenvalue). The inverse solution fits the whitened data, which means that the
    residual in each direction is weighted by :math:`1/\\lambda`: the lower the estimated
    noise in a direction, the more exactly the solution is required to reproduce the
    measured signal in that direction. The condition number of the covariance, the ratio
    between its largest and its smallest retained eigenvalue, is thus the ratio between the
    weight given to the quietest and to the noisiest direction.

    These weights are appropriate only if the small eigenvalues are reliable estimates of
    genuinely low noise, and for very small eigenvalues they are not. Maxwell filtering
    reconstructs the data from an ill-conditioned basis, which leaves directions whose
    variance is tiny but still above the tolerance that MNE-Python uses to estimate the
    rank of the covariance, so they are retained in the whitener. Their eigenvalues reflect
    the numerical properties of the filter rather than measured noise, and the smallest
    eigenvalues of a covariance estimated from a short recording are in any case the least
    accurate. When the condition number reaches ``1e10``, as it routinely does after
    Maxwell filtering, the residual in such a direction is weighted ``1e10`` times more
    than the residual in the noisiest direction, and any signal that leaks into it, for
    example through small differences in head position between the noise recording and
    the data, is fitted at the expense of the actual measurements.

    ``max_condition`` bounds this ratio. It adds the same constant to every retained
    eigenvalue (the ``reg`` parameter of :func:`mne.cov.regularize`, which adds ``reg``
    times the mean retained eigenvalue to the diagonal), with ``reg`` chosen as the smallest
    value that brings the condition number down to ``max_condition``. A covariance that
    already meets the target is left unchanged, and covariances that exceed it all end up
    with the same condition number, which keeps whitening comparable across subjects.
    Magnetometers, gradiometers and EEG channels form separate blocks, except that
    magnetometers and gradiometers form a single block after Maxwell filtering, which makes
    them linearly dependent.

    The default of ``1e6`` is meant to intervene only in the pathological range. Since
    whitening scales each direction by :math:`1/\\sqrt\\lambda`, at a condition number of
    ``1e6`` the quietest direction is amplified 1000 times more than the noisiest; at
    ``1e10``, where MNE-Python starts warning that the whitener is likely to be unstable,
    the factor is 100,000. At the other end, the default of :func:`mne.cov.regularize`
    (``reg=0.1``) bounds the condition number by roughly ten times the rank, i.e. a few
    hundred for a Maxwell-filtered recording, but it regularizes every covariance
    regardless of whether it needs it. The default sits between these two values:
    covariances that MNE-Python would regularize by default but that whiten reliably are
    left untouched, and only covariances that are far worse conditioned than MNE-Python's
    default ever produces are regularized.
